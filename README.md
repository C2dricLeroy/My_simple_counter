# My_simple_counter

## This project is a simple counter made with HTML / CSS / Javascript

I could improve this code by making a lot of major changes: 

### 1) Use textContent : Using textContent instead of innerHTML improve performance and security

### 2) Iterate event listener on buttons by using forEach()

### 3) Avoid repetitions by using querySelectorAll and switch on the event.target.id
